Description: 
void setup()
Runs ONLY ONCE when Arduino powers on or resets.
Used for initialization.
Typical things done here:
• Setting pinMode (input/output)
• Starting serial monitor
• Initializing sensors
• Starting motors/modules
Think of setup() as:
 "Prepare everything before starting the main task."
 void loop()
Runs again and again forever (infinite loop).
This is where your main program logic runs.
Everything the Arduino must keep doing goes here:
• blinking LED repeatedly
• reading sensors continuously
• controlling motors
• checking buttons
• running PID
• anything that must repeat
Think of loop() as:
 "Do this again and again until power is off."

Code: 
void setup()
 {
  Serial.begin(9600);   // Start serial communication at 9600 baud rate
}
void loop()
 {
  Serial.println("Hello World");  
// Send text to Serial Monitor
  delay(1000);       // Wait 1 second
}

Explanation:
void setup()
Serial.begin(9600);
This starts serial communication between your Arduino and your computer.
The number 9600 is the baud rate (speed of communication).
It means Arduino sends data at 9600 bits per second.
You must set the Serial Monitor to the same baud rate.

Serial.println("Hello World");
Sends this message to the Serial Monitor.
println prints the text and automatically moves to the next line.
delay(1000);
Waits for 1 second (1000 ms).
So the message is printed once per second.
